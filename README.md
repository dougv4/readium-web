# üåê Readium Web

Readium Web is a toolkit for building Web Readers. It currently supports EPUB, with plans for PDF, audiobooks and comics/manga/webtoons in future revisions.

This repo is a work in progress, but it will host documentation and project management for the Readium Web project.

Readium Web is divided into two separate toolkits:

- the [TypeScript toolkit](https://github.com/readium/ts-toolkit/tree/dev)
- and the [Go toolkit](https://github.com/readium/go-toolkit)
