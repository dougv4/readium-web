# 🌐 Readium Web

Readium Web is a toolkit for building Web Readers that support ebooks, audiobooks and comics.

This repo is a work in progress, but it will host documentation and project management for the Readium Web project.

Readium Web is divided into two separate toolkits:

- [the TypeScript toolkit](https://github.com/readium/ts-toolkit/tree/dev)
- and [the Go toolkit](https://github.com/readium/go-toolkit)
